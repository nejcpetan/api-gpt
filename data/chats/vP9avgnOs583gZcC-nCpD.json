My ability to remember things is purely context-based *within the current conversation*. Once the chat session ends, I lose access to the context.\n\nAs of now (October 2023), OpenAI has started rolling out **memory capabilities** for ChatGPT on their website (for pro users with ChatGPT Plus), but those features are not yet available through the API. The feature allows ChatGPT to \"remember\" certain details across sessionsâ€”like your name, preferences, or ongoing projectsâ€”but only in supported platforms and with user consent.\n\nIn summary:\n- **ChatGPT API** doesnâ€™t have memory yetâ€”it works statelessly. Each session is independent.\n- **ChatGPT website (for memory-enabled users)** is gradually gaining memory features, but not through the API.\n\nLet me know if youâ€™d like more specific info about these features or anything else! ðŸ˜Š",
